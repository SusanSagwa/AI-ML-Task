# AI-ML-Task
Artificial Neural Network code that trains the Network in the shared class Notebook found on eLearning by updating its weights using the delta rules of error computation found in the class lecture notes. 
Outputs the final trained weight matrices after 100 Epochs.
Makes use of Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation and Mean Squared Error to train the network.
